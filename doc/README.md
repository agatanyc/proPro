# proPRO

The proPRO project provides access to nutritional data, with an emphasis on protein density per calorie.  proPRO is neither an application nor a database, but a tool for connecting the two, supporting app developers by easy access to existing, well-respected online databases.

The project uses data from http://ashleyw.co.uk/project/food-nutrient-database
