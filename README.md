# proPro

The proPro libraries supports applications that need nutrition data.  proPro wraps information from the USDA -- an export of sr25, thanks to the [nutrient-db][] project, is included in `propro/nice` directory -- but more importantly, defines a generic interface that may be implemented atop any nutrition data source.
